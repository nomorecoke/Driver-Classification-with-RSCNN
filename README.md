# Driver-Classification-with-RSCNN-
R&amp;D Data challenge Model 

This is basic model for [Hacking and Countermeasure R&D data challenge](http://datachallenge.kr/challenge18/vehicle/introduction/)

Driver Classification with driving data set

I use RSCNN for final model  <-- you can see at [my github](https://github.com/nomorecoke/Random-Shuffle-CNN-for-swell-prediction) for detail RSCNN code

Dataset is private, but you can see data processing and model code
